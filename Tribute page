<p align=center>Vivekananda was the chief disciple of Shri Ramakrishna Paramahansa.SHe was the founder of Ramakrishna Mission. He introduced Hindu philosophy of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America. He brought Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p align=center>Vivekananda is considered to be a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India. He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech beginning with "Sisters and Brothers of America". Through this he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions at Chicago in 1893.</p>

Swami Vivekananda was immensely influenced by the Brahmo Samaj and his guru Sri Paramahamsa Ramakrishna. Swami Vivekananda was deeply inclined towards spirituality and being influenced by his guru Ramakrishna, he learned that all human beings are images of Divine Shiva and one should see Lord Shiva through mankind’s services.  

In 1886, Sri Ramakrishna passed away leaving all his disciples and socio reforms work to be directed by Swami Vivekananda. In 1888, he founded the Ramakrishna Mission, one of India’s leading charitable institutions. The main teachings of the Ramakrishna Mission were about social service regardless of any returns, unconditional love for mankind and nature, and considering all humans, religions, divisions, and sects on equal grounds. The Ramakrishna Mission spreads the teachings and preaching of Ramakrishna. According to Sri Paramahamsa Ramakrishna “whichever path one follows with sincerity and full devotion to reach God, that sincerity and Devotion will surely pave the way and reaches the ultimatum in finding God”.<br><br>
